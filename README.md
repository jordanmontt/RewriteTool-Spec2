# This is Rewrite Tools Set

RewriteToolsSet is a set of Pharo's modular tools that can be used together or separately. It allows you to do complex code transformations and refactors. You can create custom code transformation rules and transform the code of a set of classes with them.
This tools allow you to can create, store, load, test, match and apply custom transformations rules with this set of tools. As well, you can apply the custom transformation rules to a specific set of classes or to the entire Pharo's system. You can refactor or replace deprecated methods (or any method) with this tool!

RewriteToolsSet was created over the basis of two tools: Mark Rizun's [RewriteTool](http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~MarkRizun/RewriteTool) and Yuriy Tymchuk's [MatchTool](https://github.com/Uko/MatchTool). Those tools use a deprecated version on the `Spec` library. RewriteToolsSet refactors and enhances those tools in addition to adding more tools and a lot of more functionalities. Moreover, RewriteToolsSet is built using the new version of the library `Spec` which is called: `Spec2`.

## UI explanation

RewriteTool consists of seven modular tools:
- [Rewrite Basic Editor](#rewrite-basic-editor)
- [Rewrite Rule Builder Editor](#rewrite-rule-builder-editor)
- [Match Tool](#match-tool)
- [Rewrite Rule Applier](#rewrite-rule-applier)
- [Rewrite Rule Loader](#rewrite-rule-loader)
- [Rewrite Changes Browser](#rewrite-changes-browser)
- [Rewrite Helper Browser](#rewrite-helper-browser)

As been said, these modular tools can be perfectly used independently or in combination.

### Rewrite Basic Editor

This is the principal tool that conects all the other ones. It loads with a defafult Rewrite Rule. It has a basic cheat sheet for the Rewrite Rules syntax. If you want a deeper explanation, you can open the Rewrite Helper Browser.
- Press the _More Help_ button to open the helper browser which contains an explanation of the Rewrite Rules syntax.
- Press the _Save rule_ button to save the current rule.
- Press the _Apply on selection..._ button to open the Rewrite Applier, which allows to apply the rule to a selected set of classes.
- Press the _Apply on all classes_ button to apply the current rule to all classes in the PharoÂ´s system.
- Press the _Match Tool_ button to open Match Tool.
- Press the _Build rule_ button to open Rewrite Rule Builder Editor.
- Press the _Load a rule_ button to open the loader which allows you to load any rule that you have previously saved.

### Rewrite Rule Builder Editor

This is a tool that allows to build a Rewrite Rule from Pharo code. You can paste Pharo code in the panels and select the parts of the code that you want to abstract into pattern code.

### Match Tool

This is a tool that allows you to match and test a Rewrite Rule. You press the _Match_ button and it will match the rule with the Pharo's code. The middle column shows all the occurrences of the rule in the Pharo's code. The right column shows all the bindings of the selected matched of the middle column.

### Rewrite Rule Applier

This is a tool that allows you to apply any custom rule to any class or classes. In the first column on the left you can select one or several packages. The middle column will be populated with the classes of the packages that you have selected. Then, you can select one or more classes, those classes will be the ones that will be refactored by the rule. The methods column will be populated with the methods of those classes but cannot be selected. The rule can only be applied to entire classes, not only to methods.

In the bottom left corner, there is a dropdown menu with all the saved rules, that is the rule that will be applied to the selected classes. With the checkbox button, you can choose to show only the rules you have created or show the example rules too. You can apply that rule either to all system classes or only to the selected ones.

### Rewrite Rule Loader

This is a simple tool that shows a list of all the custom Rewrite Rules saved. You can choose to load a rule in the Basic Rewrite Editor, in the Builder Editor or in MatchTool. Also, you can choose to delete the rule or to show only the rules that you have created.

### Rewrite Changes Browser

![Rewrite Changes Browser](https://i.imgur.com/sAOHL8K.png)

Before the rule is applied to one or many classes, the Changes Browser will open. This is a tool that shows all the changes that will be made and how the methods will be changed.

### Rewrite Helper Browser
