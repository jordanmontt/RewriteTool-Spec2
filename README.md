# This is Rewrite Tools Set

Rewrite Tools Set is a set of Pharo's modular tools that can be used together or separately. It allows you to create, store, load, test and match custom Rewrite Rules. It also allows you to apply the custom Rewrite Rules to specific classes or to the entire Pharo's system. You can refactor or replace deprecated methods (or any method) with this tool!

RewriteTool was created over the basis of two tools: Mark Rizun's [RewriteTool](http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~MarkRizun/RewriteTool) and Yuriy Tymchuk's [MatchTool](https://github.com/Uko/MatchTool) that use a deprecated version on the `Spec` library. RewriteTool refactors and enhances those tools in addition to adding more tools and more functionalities. Moreover, RewriteTool is built using the new version of the library `Spec` which is called: `Spec2`.

If you have any issues or have any feedback, please feel welcome to submit them.

### Rewrite Rule Applier

This is a tool that allows you to apply any custom rule to any class or classes. In the first column on the left you can select one or several packages. The middle column will be populated with the classes of the packages that you have selected. Then, you can select one or more classes, those classes will be the ones that will be refactored by the rule. The methods column will be populated with the methods of those classes but cannot be selected. The rule can only be applied to classes, not to specific methods.

In the bottom left corner, there is a dropdown menu with all the saved rules, that is the rule that will be applied to the selected classes. You can apply that rule either to all system classes or only to the selected ones. If you press the _Edit Rule_ button the Rewrite Basic Editor will be opened with the selected rule.

### Rewrite Changes Browser

Before the rule is applied to one or many classes, the Changes Browser will open. This is a tool that shows all the changes that will be made and how the methods will be changed.

### Rewrite Rule Loader

This is a simple tool that shows a list of all the custom Rewrite Rules saved. You can either choose to load a rule in the Basic Rewrite Editor or to delete the rule.

### Match Tool
