# This is Rewrite Tools Set

RewriteToolsSet is a set of Pharo's modular tools that can be used together or separately. It allows you to create, store, load, test, match and apply custom Rewrite Rules. You can apply the custom Rewrite Rules to a specific set of classes or to the entire Pharo's system. You can refactor or replace deprecated methods (or any method) with this tool!

RewriteToolsSet was created over the basis of two tools: Mark Rizun's [RewriteTool](http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~MarkRizun/RewriteTool) and Yuriy Tymchuk's [MatchTool](https://github.com/Uko/MatchTool). Those tools use a deprecated version on the `Spec` library. RewriteToolsSet refactors and enhances those tools in addition to adding more tools and a lot of more functionalities. Moreover, RewriteToolsSet is built using the new version of the library `Spec` which is called: `Spec2`.

### Rewrite Rule Applier

This is a tool that allows you to apply any custom rule to any class or classes. In the first column on the left you can select one or several packages. The middle column will be populated with the classes of the packages that you have selected. Then, you can select one or more classes, those classes will be the ones that will be refactored by the rule. The methods column will be populated with the methods of those classes but cannot be selected. The rule can only be applied to classes, not to specific methods.

In the bottom left corner, there is a dropdown menu with all the saved rules, that is the rule that will be applied to the selected classes. You can apply that rule either to all system classes or only to the selected ones. If you press the _Edit Rule_ button the Rewrite Basic Editor will be opened with the selected rule.

### Rewrite Rule Loader

This is a simple tool that shows a list of all the custom Rewrite Rules saved. You can either choose to load a rule in the Basic Rewrite Editor or to delete the rule.

### Rewrite Changes Browser

Before the rule is applied to one or many classes, the Changes Browser will open. This is a tool that shows all the changes that will be made and how the methods will be changed.

### Rewrite Helper Browser

This is a Helper Browser which contains an explanation of how to create Rewrite Rules and how the Rewrite Rules's syntax work.
